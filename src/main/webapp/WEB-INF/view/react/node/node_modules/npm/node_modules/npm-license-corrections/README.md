SPDX license expressions for npm packages without proper metadata

[licensee](https://www.npmjs.com/package/licensee) uses this package, along with [correct-license-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/correct-license-metdata), to find valid license expressions for npm packages without them.

# Schema

This package exports an Array of Objects.  Each Object looks like:

```json
{
  "name": "optimist",
  "version": "6.0.1",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

`license` contains a valid SPDX license expression for `version` of package `name`.

`name` may contain a scope, as well as a package name, like `@scope/package`.
