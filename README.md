4. After you clone this repo and download IntelliJ. Open the project in IntelliJ, go to the pom.xml file, right click and select Build as a Maven Project. This should import all the dependencies. 
5. to start the dev server for viewing and making changes in the frontend, go to the frontend/ directory and execute `npm start` on command line. 
6. If you want your dev server to be able to talk to the REST APIs, open IntelliJ and execute clean install in the Maven command line, run the project normally or run the .JAR file created in the target/ direcotry. Now, your dev server is ready to talk to the backend!
